james alfred ` jimmy ' moody -lrb- 27 february 1941 , looe , cornwall - 1 june 1993 , hackney , london -rrb- was an english gangster and hitman whose career spanned more than four decades and included run-ins with jack spot , billy hill , `` mad '' frankie fraser , the krays , the richardsons and the provisional ira .
he was born to a mother who was a wartime evacuee from camberwell , south east london .
his father was killed during ww2 after his ship was torpedoed by a u-boat .
moody was the number one enforcer for the richardsons , did freelance `` work '' for the krays , and became one of the most feared criminals to emerge from the london underworld all before he reached the age of 30 .
he was considered by many of his peers to be `` the hardest man in london '' .
in the 1970s , moody joined a team of criminals to form the chainsaw gang who went on to become that decade 's most successful armed robbers .
at this time he could be very blase about the nature of his work , for instance according to his biographer wensley clarkson , although he was a kind and devoted family man he often cleaned his shotguns on the kitchen table in front of his family and once even asked his wife to lend him her tights as a mask for a disguise .
moody was convicted of manslaughter in 1967 for the killing of a young merchant navy steward .
he was released in 1972 , however he was sent in 1979 on remand to brixton prison to await trial for armed robbery .
his cellmate was provisional ira member gerard tuite .
in 1980 the two men escaped and went on the run .
soon , his murderous skills were being put to use as he became a paid hitman for the provos against their own .
moody did not care for politics , just a paid job and was never a member of the ira or a republican sympathiser .
by the late 1980s , moody realised he was in danger of overstaying his welcome in ireland and , inevitably , the lure of london persuaded him to return home .
he believed his reputation as a hired killer would keep him one step ahead of trouble - and the law .
but the london he returned to was a very different place .
huge drug deals - mainly involving ecstasy and cocaine - rather than armed robbery were financing many criminals ' lavish lifestyles .
the stakes were higher and so were the profits .
by the early 1990s , moody 's list of enemies read like a who 's who of criminals from both sides of the water .
then there were the police , the royal ulster constabulary and the british security services .
moody was shot dead in june 1993 in the royal hotel -lrb- now royal inn on the park -rrb- in hackney , east london by an unknown assassin .

there were also five draws .

i do n't mean just money .
it taught us how to live , how to act , how to eat , how to be physically fit .
it opened doors to places that we never could have gotten into .
some made more money than others , but every boxer looks at his career as the most important experience in his life . ''

luitenant-admiraal conrad emil lambert helfrich , gnl , kcb -lrb- 11 october 1886 -- 20 september 1962 -rrb- of the royal netherlands navy was a leading dutch naval figure of world war ii .
he was born in semarang .
`` in the early 1920s , when he was teaching other young sprouts at den helder , his favorite lecture was on the coming war between the u.s. and japan .
`` when ? ''
his students would ask him , and he would boom : `` in this generation . ''
then he would stride to a blackboard map and chalk three xs -- on pearl harbor , the panama canal , san francisco .
` there , ' he would say , ` the attacks will fall . ' ''
helfrich was appointed overall commander of all forces in the netherlands east indies in october 1939 .
at the outbreak of the war in the pacific he gave instructions to wage war aggressively .
his small force of submarines sank more japanese ships in the first weeks of the war than the entire british and us navies together , an exploit which earned him the nickname `` ship-a-day helfrich '' .
admiral helfrich worked tirelessly to establish co-operation with the allied navies in the area since he knew that the dutch could not hope to protect the dutch east indies by themselves .
when a combined command -lrb- abda -rrb- was finally created in january 1942 , he was bypassed for the post of commander of the navy , in favour of admiral thomas c. hart of the united states navy .

hanna beata gronkiewicz-waltz -lrb- , born 4 november 1952 in warsaw -rrb- is a polish liberal politician who has been the mayor of warsaw since 2 december 2006 .
she is the first woman to hold this position .
between 1992 and 2000 , she was the chairman of the national bank of poland , the central bank of poland .
she resigned to take the position of the deputy chairman of european bank for reconstruction and development , a position she held between 2001 and 2004 .

in the 2006 municipal elections , gronkiewicz-waltz served as civic platform 's nominee for mayor of warsaw .
on 12 november she gained 34.23 % , finishing next to law and justice candidate , former prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
as neither received 50 percent of the vote , a second round election was held on 26 november , where gronkiewicz-waltz received 53.18 % of the votes , winning the election .
in january 2007 , just a few weeks into her term , gronkiewicz-waltz was at the center of a controversy that could have cost her the office .
a law enacted in 2005 obliged the mayors of polish municipalities to publicly disclose their own as well as their spouse 's financial circumstances .
the law requires the successful candidate 's disclosure statement to be provided within 30 days after the inauguration , whereas the statement regarding the candidate 's spouse is to be submitted within 30 days after the actual election .
gronkiewicz-waltz submitted her own and her husband 's statements on 2 january 2007 , exactly 30 days after her inauguration .
on 20 january , the newspaper `` dziennik '' reported that mr. waltz 's documents had been two days past the deadline , which in his case had been on 28 december 2006 .
based on this , prime minister jarosław kaczyński of the governing law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party maintained that gronkiewicz-waltz 's mandate had expired on 28 december 2006 , and announced that the local elections would be repeated .
gronkiewicz-waltz 's party civic platform argued that the prime minister did not have the authority to make this decision , and that the case would need to be examined in court instead .
polish legal experts maintained that by submitting their statements on the same day , gronkiewicz-waltz had observed the spirit , if not the letter of the law .
also , having two different deadlines for the statements could be considered as an unconstitutional legal trap .
in the meantime , civic platform announced that it would nominate gronkiewicz-waltz again , should the elections need to be repeated .
on 13 march 2007 , poland 's constitutional tribunal ruled against the governing law and justice party and struck down the controversial law that threatened her and many other public officials with the loss of their positions solely because they did not file paper work on time .
regarding gay parades in the capital , gronkiewicz-waltz has taken the opposite stand to her predecessor , approving a gay pride parade .
though gay parades have been officially allowed in the past , they had always met with strong resistance during the term of lech kaczyński as mayor of warsaw , particularly from the all-polish youth movement .
gronkiewicz-waltz said the parade would pose no threat to morals and pointed to this month 's ruling by the european court of human rights that kaczyński had acted illegally and discriminatory in banning the gay pride marches .
-lsb- http://www.365gay.com/newscon07/05/051807warsaw.htm] in the november 2010 municipal elections , gronkiewicz-waltz was reelected as the mayor -lrb- or `` president '' -rrb- of warsaw , winning 53.67 % of the votes outright in the first round , making a second round unnecessary .
hanna gronkiewicz-waltz was along with monika olejnik , an influential journalist , a murder target of brunon k. , who was arrested in november 2012 in connection with preparation of terrorist attack on sejm .

christina oiticica -lrb- born on 23 november 1951 in rio de janeiro -rrb- is a brazilian artist .
she has been married to paulo coelho since 1980 .
oiticica is known for using an exotic neoconcretist technique that reminds both the land art and the eco art - a technique that allows nature 's elements to act upon her works .
oiticica is a `` daughter '' of the experimental art movement of the 1970s arisen in rio de janeiro , where she was born , and has taken her paintings to all four corners of the world .
oiticica idealized the combination of land art -- which uses nature as foundation matter -- with a painting in the french pyrenees , five years ago , when she decided to paint a 10-meter long canvas in the middle of nature in the open air , as she realized not to have a covered area that would enable her to create on such surface .
once her work was finished , she left it to dry right there , outside .
on the next day , as she went back to pick it up , she found that dust , dirt , leaves and some insects had been integrated to the canvas . ''
`` with no premeditation , nature had given its unique touch to the painting . '' ''
the artist began this technique painting in the forests , valleys and mountains of the pyrenees , in france .
the result of this work is her book `` the four seasons '' .
soon after , between 2004 and 2005 she buried many canvases in the amazon rainforest forest in brazil and waited a year to retrieve them .
the humid and equatorial forest left their indelible marks on her paintings .
also in 2005 she took her work up to the sacred valley of ganespura , in india .
between 2006 and 2008 , oiticica elected the saint james way , a sacred and symbolic place that receives pilgrims from all over the world , as her studio .
she composed her canvases at different locations along the way , using the relief of rocks , the intervention of rain , snow , the color of the soil , natural pigments and wax .
once composed , they were `` planted '' on the ground and recovered months later .
generally , oiticica leaves her canvases `` planted '' for a period of nine months -lrb- the cycle of a pregnancy -rrb- or for one year -lrb- cycle of the four seasons -rrb- .
scott edward kazmir -lrb- ; born january 24 , 1984 -rrb- is an american professional baseball pitcher for the houston astros of major league baseball -lrb- mlb -rrb- .
after a stellar high school career in his hometown of houston , texas , kazmir was drafted in the first round of the 2002 major league baseball draft by the new york mets , who later sent him to the tampa bay devil rays in a highly publicized and criticized trade .
kazmir made his major league debut with the devil rays on august 23 , , when he was only 20 years old .
despite his age , kazmir quickly became one of the better lefthanded starting pitchers in baseball , primarily by relying on a mid-90s fastball paired with a sharp breaking slider .
over the next several years , kazmir was one of the few bright spots on devil rays teams that lost 90 + games per season .
he is still among the all-time leaders in many franchise pitching categories , including strikeouts , earned run average -lrb- era -rrb- , wins , and games started .
nagging injuries lead to inconsistency in kazmir 's pitching motion and gradually reduced his pitch velocity and overall effectiveness beginning in .
the rays traded kazmir to the los angeles angels of anaheim in august , where he performed well for a time .
however , his effectiveness deteriorated during the season , when he posted the highest era among american league starting pitchers .

anne hyde -lrb- 12 march 163731 march 1671 -rrb- was duchess of york and of albany as the first wife of the future king james ii of england .
originally anglican , her father was a lawyer .
anne married james in 1660 after she became pregnant by him , but james is said to have promised to marry her in 1659 .
the two first met in the netherlands while anne was living in the household of james ' sister mary .
james and anne had eight children , but six died in early childhood .
the two who survived to adulthood were lady mary , who succeeded her father after his deposition during the glorious revolution of 1688 and lady anne , who succeeded her brother-in-law and became the first monarch of great britain .
born the daughter of a commoner -- edward hyde -lrb- later created earl of clarendon -rrb- , anne is best known for her marriage to james , which caused much gossip .
two months after the marriage , anne gave birth to the couple 's first child , who had obviously been conceived out of wedlock .
until near the end of anne 's life , some observers disapproved of james ' decision to marry anne ; but not king charles ii , james ' brother , who wanted the marriage to take place .
another cause of disapproval was the public affection james showed towards anne , such as kissing and leaning against each other , which was considered improper behaviour during the 1600s .
james was a known philanderer who kept many mistresses , for which anne often reproached him , once even complaining to the king , who sent one of james ' mistresses to the countryside where she remained until her death .
nonetheless , james fathered many illegitimate children .
anne was the reason her husband converted to catholicism , having both been exposed to catholicism during visits to the netherlands and france .
anne was so strongly attracted to this religion that she converted quickly after her marriage .
years later , james followed suit , which was a contributing factor to the glorious revolution .
anne suffered from advanced breast cancer and died shortly after giving birth to her last child .

martin johnson heade -lrb- august 11 , 1819 -- september 4 , 1904 -rrb- was a prolific american painter known for his salt marsh landscapes , seascapes , and depictions of tropical birds -lrb- such as hummingbirds -rrb- , as well as lotus blossoms and other still lifes .
his painting style and subject matter , while derived from the romanticism of the time , are regarded by art historians as a significant departure from those of his peers .
heade was born in lumberville , pennsylvania , the son of a storekeeper .
he studied with edward hicks , and possibly with thomas hicks .
his earliest works were produced during the 1840s and were chiefly portraits .
he travelled to europe several times as a young man , became an itinerant artist on american shores , and exhibited in philadelphia in 1841 and new york in 1843 .
friendships with artists of the hudson river school led to an interest in landscape art .
in 1863 , he planned to publish a volume of brazilian hummingbirds and tropical flowers , but the project was eventually abandoned .
he travelled to the tropics several times thereafter , and continued to paint birds and flowers .
heade married in 1883 and moved to st. augustine , florida .
his chief works from this period were floridian landscapes and flowers , particularly magnolias laid upon velvet cloth .
he died in 1904 .
his best known works are depictions of light and shadow upon the salt marshes of new england .
heade was not a widely known artist during his lifetime , but his work attracted the notice of scholars , art historians , and collectors during the 1940s .
he quickly became recognized as a major american artist .
although often considered a hudson river school artist , some critics and scholars take exception to this categorization .
heade 's works are now in major museums and collections .
his paintings are occasionally discovered in unlikely places such as garage sales and flea markets .

ba cụt and his forces fought the vietnamese national army -lrb- vna -rrb- , the việt minh , and the cao Đài religious movement from 1943 until his capture in 1956 .
known for his idiosyncrasies , he was regarded as an erratic and cruel leader who fought with little ideological purpose .
his sobriquet came from the self-amputation of his left index finger -lrb- although it was erroneously reported that it was his middle or `` third cut finger '' -rrb- .
he later swore not to cut his hair until the communist việt minh were defeated .
ba cụt frequently made alliances with various vietnamese factions and the french .
he invariably accepted the material support offered in return for his cooperation , and then broke the agreement -- nevertheless , the french made deals with him on five occasions .
the french position was weak because their military forces had been depleted by world war ii , and they had great difficulty in re-establishing control over french indochina , which had been left with a power vacuum after the defeat of japan .
in mid-1955 , the tide turned against the various sects , as prime minister ngô Đình diệm of the state of vietnam and his vna began to consolidate their grip on the south .
ba cụt and his allies were driven into the jungle , and their position was threatened by government offensives .
after almost a year of fighting , ba cụt was captured .
he was sentenced to death and publicly beheaded in cần thơ .
