james alfred ` jimmy ' moody -lrb- 27 february 1941 , looe , cornwall - 1 june 1993 , hackney , london -rrb- was an english gangster and hitman whose career spanned more than four decades and included run-ins with jack spot , billy hill , `` mad '' frankie fraser , the krays , the richardsons and the provisional ira .
he was born to a mother who was a wartime evacuee from camberwell , south east london .
his father was killed during ww2 after his ship was torpedoed by a u-boat .
moody was the number one enforcer for the richardsons , did freelance `` work '' for the krays , and became one of the most feared criminals to emerge from the london underworld all before he reached the age of 30 .
he was considered by many of his peers to be `` the hardest man in london '' .
in the 1970s , moody joined a team of criminals to form the chainsaw gang who went on to become that decade 's most successful armed robbers .
at this time he could be very blase about the nature of his work , for instance according to his biographer wensley clarkson , although he was a kind and devoted family man he often cleaned his shotguns on the kitchen table in front of his family and once even asked his wife to lend him her tights as a mask for a disguise .
moody was convicted of manslaughter in 1967 for the killing of a young merchant navy steward .
he was released in 1972 , however he was sent in 1979 on remand to brixton prison to await trial for armed robbery .
his cellmate was provisional ira member gerard tuite .
in 1980 the two men escaped and went on the run .
soon , his murderous skills were being put to use as he became a paid hitman for the provos against their own .
moody did not care for politics , just a paid job and was never a member of the ira or a republican sympathiser .
by the late 1980s , moody realised he was in danger of overstaying his welcome in ireland and , inevitably , the lure of london persuaded him to return home .
he believed his reputation as a hired killer would keep him one step ahead of trouble - and the law .
but the london he returned to was a very different place .
huge drug deals - mainly involving ecstasy and cocaine - rather than armed robbery were financing many criminals ' lavish lifestyles .
the stakes were higher and so were the profits .
by the early 1990s , moody 's list of enemies read like a who 's who of criminals from both sides of the water .
then there were the police , the royal ulster constabulary and the british security services .
moody was shot dead in june 1993 in the royal hotel -lrb- now royal inn on the park -rrb- in hackney , east london by an unknown assassin .

there were also five draws .
reflecting on his decade in the ring , kronowitz said : `` the thing about boxing is that it gave every one of us everything we have .
i do n't mean just money .
it taught us how to live , how to act , how to eat , how to be physically fit .
it opened doors to places that we never could have gotten into .
some made more money than others , but every boxer looks at his career as the most important experience in his life . ''

a member of the bagrationi dynasty , her position as the first woman to rule georgia in her own right was emphasized by the title `` mep ` e '' -lrb- `` king '' -rrb- , commonly afforded to tamar in the medieval georgian sources .
tamar was proclaimed heir and co-ruler by her reigning father george iii in 1178 , but she faced significant opposition from the aristocracy upon her ascension to full ruling powers after george 's death .
tamar was successful in neutralizing this opposition and embarked on an energetic foreign policy aided by the decline of the hostile seljuq turks .
relying on a powerful military √©lite , tamar was able to build on the successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire which dominated the caucasus until its collapse under the mongol attacks within two decades after tamar 's death .

luitenant-admiraal conrad emil lambert helfrich , gnl , kcb -lrb- 11 october 1886 -- 20 september 1962 -rrb- of the royal netherlands navy was a leading dutch naval figure of world war ii .
he was born in semarang .
`` in the early 1920s , when he was teaching other young sprouts at den helder , his favorite lecture was on the coming war between the u.s. and japan .
`` when ? ''
his students would ask him , and he would boom : `` in this generation . ''
then he would stride to a blackboard map and chalk three xs -- on pearl harbor , the panama canal , san francisco .
` there , ' he would say , ` the attacks will fall . ' ''
helfrich was appointed overall commander of all forces in the netherlands east indies in october 1939 .
at the outbreak of the war in the pacific he gave instructions to wage war aggressively .
his small force of submarines sank more japanese ships in the first weeks of the war than the entire british and us navies together , an exploit which earned him the nickname `` ship-a-day helfrich '' .
admiral helfrich worked tirelessly to establish co-operation with the allied navies in the area since he knew that the dutch could not hope to protect the dutch east indies by themselves .
when a combined command -lrb- abda -rrb- was finally created in january 1942 , he was bypassed for the post of commander of the navy , in favour of admiral thomas c. hart of the united states navy .
helfrich 's mission to defend java at all costs clashed with hart 's desire to conserve as many naval units as possible .
on 12 february 1942 , helfrich succeeded hart as commander of the american-british-dutch-australian naval forces in the pacific and immediately went on the offensive .
unfortunately , the courage of the ` striking force ' was to no avail in the face of the overwhelming superiority of the japanese navy and after the disastrous battle of the java sea most of the abda ships under his command had been put out of action and abda itself was dismantled .
helfrich spent the remainder of the war in ceylon preparing the return of dutch administration to the dutch east indies .
in 1945 , he was given command of all dutch naval forces and promoted to luitenant-admiraal .
on 2 september 1945 , he signed the japanese instrument of surrender aboard the battleship uss `` missouri '' on behalf of the kingdom of the netherlands .
helfrich returned to the dutch east indies on 1 october 1945 , where he commanded the dutch forces in the dutch east indies until 24 january 1946 when the post of commander of the armed forces in the east was abolished .
while commander helfrich was involved with military opposition to the indonesian national revolution .
he was a fierce opponent of reaching a compromise with sukarno and he , supported by chief of the general staff hendrik johan kruls , objected to the linggarjati agreement of 15 december 1946 , without effect .
he remained in command until his retirement from the navy on 1 january 1949 .
he wrote his memoirs which were published in 1950 and he died in the hague , on 20 september 1962 .

hanna beata gronkiewicz-waltz -lrb- , born 4 november 1952 in warsaw -rrb- is a polish liberal politician who has been the mayor of warsaw since 2 december 2006 .
she is the first woman to hold this position .
between 1992 and 2000 , she was the chairman of the national bank of poland , the central bank of poland .
she resigned to take the position of the deputy chairman of european bank for reconstruction and development , a position she held between 2001 and 2004 .

in the 2006 municipal elections , gronkiewicz-waltz served as civic platform 's nominee for mayor of warsaw .
on 12 november she gained 34.23 % , finishing next to law and justice candidate , former prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
as neither received 50 percent of the vote , a second round election was held on 26 november , where gronkiewicz-waltz received 53.18 % of the votes , winning the election .
in january 2007 , just a few weeks into her term , gronkiewicz-waltz was at the center of a controversy that could have cost her the office .
a law enacted in 2005 obliged the mayors of polish municipalities to publicly disclose their own as well as their spouse 's financial circumstances .
the law requires the successful candidate 's disclosure statement to be provided within 30 days after the inauguration , whereas the statement regarding the candidate 's spouse is to be submitted within 30 days after the actual election .
gronkiewicz-waltz submitted her own and her husband 's statements on 2 january 2007 , exactly 30 days after her inauguration .
on 20 january , the newspaper `` dziennik '' reported that mr. waltz 's documents had been two days past the deadline , which in his case had been on 28 december 2006 .
based on this , prime minister jaros≈Çaw kaczy≈Ñski of the governing law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party maintained that gronkiewicz-waltz 's mandate had expired on 28 december 2006 , and announced that the local elections would be repeated .
gronkiewicz-waltz 's party civic platform argued that the prime minister did not have the authority to make this decision , and that the case would need to be examined in court instead .
polish legal experts maintained that by submitting their statements on the same day , gronkiewicz-waltz had observed the spirit , if not the letter of the law .
also , having two different deadlines for the statements could be considered as an unconstitutional legal trap .
in the meantime , civic platform announced that it would nominate gronkiewicz-waltz again , should the elections need to be repeated .
on 13 march 2007 , poland 's constitutional tribunal ruled against the governing law and justice party and struck down the controversial law that threatened her and many other public officials with the loss of their positions solely because they did not file paper work on time .
regarding gay parades in the capital , gronkiewicz-waltz has taken the opposite stand to her predecessor , approving a gay pride parade .
though gay parades have been officially allowed in the past , they had always met with strong resistance during the term of lech kaczy≈Ñski as mayor of warsaw , particularly from the all-polish youth movement .
gronkiewicz-waltz said the parade would pose no threat to morals and pointed to this month 's ruling by the european court of human rights that kaczy≈Ñski had acted illegally and discriminatory in banning the gay pride marches .
-lsb- http://www.365gay.com/newscon07/05/051807warsaw.htm] in the november 2010 municipal elections , gronkiewicz-waltz was reelected as the mayor -lrb- or `` president '' -rrb- of warsaw , winning 53.67 % of the votes outright in the first round , making a second round unnecessary .
hanna gronkiewicz-waltz was along with monika olejnik , an influential journalist , a murder target of brunon k. , who was arrested in november 2012 in connection with preparation of terrorist attack on sejm .

scott edward kazmir -lrb- ; born january 24 , 1984 -rrb- is an american professional baseball pitcher for the houston astros of major league baseball -lrb- mlb -rrb- .
after a stellar high school career in his hometown of houston , texas , kazmir was drafted in the first round of the 2002 major league baseball draft by the new york mets , who later sent him to the tampa bay devil rays in a highly publicized and criticized trade .
kazmir made his major league debut with the devil rays on august 23 , , when he was only 20 years old .
despite his age , kazmir quickly became one of the better lefthanded starting pitchers in baseball , primarily by relying on a mid-90s fastball paired with a sharp breaking slider .
over the next several years , kazmir was one of the few bright spots on devil rays teams that lost 90 + games per season .
he is still among the all-time leaders in many franchise pitching categories , including strikeouts , earned run average -lrb- era -rrb- , wins , and games started .
nagging injuries lead to inconsistency in kazmir 's pitching motion and gradually reduced his pitch velocity and overall effectiveness beginning in .
the rays traded kazmir to the los angeles angels of anaheim in august , where he performed well for a time .
however , his effectiveness deteriorated during the season , when he posted the highest era among american league starting pitchers .
continued poor performances during spring training in led the angels to send kazmir to the minor leagues to retool his mechanics and regain his confidence , but continued ineffectiveness there led to his release in june 2011 .
after months of individual work and short stints with independent minor league and winter league teams in 2012 and 2013 , kazmir signed a minor league deal with the cleveland indians before the season .
solid performances in spring training earned him a spot in the indians ' starting rotation , and he pitched well enough during the 2013 season to come in third in the voting for american league comeback player of the year .
in december 2013 , kazmir signed a two-year contract with the oakland athletics and continued his resurgence by winning a career-high 15 games during the season .
the athletics traded kazmir to the astros in 2015 for two minor league prospects .

anne hyde -lrb- 12 march 163731 march 1671 -rrb- was duchess of york and of albany as the first wife of the future king james ii of england .
originally anglican , her father was a lawyer .
anne married james in 1660 after she became pregnant by him , but james is said to have promised to marry her in 1659 .
the two first met in the netherlands while anne was living in the household of james ' sister mary .
james and anne had eight children , but six died in early childhood .
the two who survived to adulthood were lady mary , who succeeded her father after his deposition during the glorious revolution of 1688 and lady anne , who succeeded her brother-in-law and became the first monarch of great britain .
born the daughter of a commoner -- edward hyde -lrb- later created earl of clarendon -rrb- , anne is best known for her marriage to james , which caused much gossip .
two months after the marriage , anne gave birth to the couple 's first child , who had obviously been conceived out of wedlock .
until near the end of anne 's life , some observers disapproved of james ' decision to marry anne ; but not king charles ii , james ' brother , who wanted the marriage to take place .
another cause of disapproval was the public affection james showed towards anne , such as kissing and leaning against each other , which was considered improper behaviour during the 1600s .
james was a known philanderer who kept many mistresses , for which anne often reproached him , once even complaining to the king , who sent one of james ' mistresses to the countryside where she remained until her death .
nonetheless , james fathered many illegitimate children .
anne was the reason her husband converted to catholicism , having both been exposed to catholicism during visits to the netherlands and france .
anne was so strongly attracted to this religion that she converted quickly after her marriage .
years later , james followed suit , which was a contributing factor to the glorious revolution .
anne suffered from advanced breast cancer and died shortly after giving birth to her last child .

his painting style and subject matter , while derived from the romanticism of the time , are regarded by art historians as a significant departure from those of his peers .
heade was born in lumberville , pennsylvania , the son of a storekeeper .
he studied with edward hicks , and possibly with thomas hicks .
his earliest works were produced during the 1840s and were chiefly portraits .
he travelled to europe several times as a young man , became an itinerant artist on american shores , and exhibited in philadelphia in 1841 and new york in 1843 .
friendships with artists of the hudson river school led to an interest in landscape art .
in 1863 , he planned to publish a volume of brazilian hummingbirds and tropical flowers , but the project was eventually abandoned .
he travelled to the tropics several times thereafter , and continued to paint birds and flowers .
heade married in 1883 and moved to st. augustine , florida .
his chief works from this period were floridian landscapes and flowers , particularly magnolias laid upon velvet cloth .
he died in 1904 .
his best known works are depictions of light and shadow upon the salt marshes of new england .
heade was not a widely known artist during his lifetime , but his work attracted the notice of scholars , art historians , and collectors during the 1940s .
he quickly became recognized as a major american artist .
although often considered a hudson river school artist , some critics and scholars take exception to this categorization .
heade 's works are now in major museums and collections .
